    "In this project, you will create your own dataset of security vulnerabilities. This dataset shoul be generated using the information contained in ProjectKB. ProjectKB is a repository created to enable the creation, management and aggregation of a distributed and collaborative knowledge base of vulnerabilities affecting open-source software written in Java programming language. This repository contains a list of CVEs and the corresponding commits that fix it. Usually the vulnerabilities are contained in a method. Your task is to use this repository to extract the vulnerable and fixed version of the methods."
